This is an attempt to provide tritonus, mp3spi, jlayer, jorbis and vorbisspi as JPMS-compatible modules.

It may not work correctly at the moment.

## TODO

- [x] Migrate jlayer tests
- [x] Migrate mp3spi tests
- [x] Migrate vorbisspi tests
- [ ] Migrate tritonus tests (For the distributed subset here, not all tests)
- [ ] Modernize code
